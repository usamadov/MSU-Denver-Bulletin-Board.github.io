# Senior Project: Real-Time Bulletin Board

## Overview

Welcome to our senior project repository! This project aims to create a website using GitHub Pages, HTML, and JavaScript to facilitate real-time updates from teachers that will be displayed on a bulletin board in the MSU Denver Aerospace and Engineering Sciences 2nd floor hallway. We are using Anthias to display our website on the bulletin board. 

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates:** Utilizing JavaScript and Firebase, the platform allows teachers to post real-time updates that students can instantly view.
- **File Uploads:** Teachers can upload and share files, documents, and other resources with their classes, enhancing the learning experience.
- **Secure Authentication:** User authentication ensures that only authorized teachers can access and manage the platform's content.

## Technologies Used

- **GitHub Pages:** Hosts the static website, making it accessible to users without the need for a dedicated server.
- **HTML:** Provides the structure and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript:** Enables dynamic and interactive features on the client side.
- **Firebase:** Powers real-time updates and file uploads, ensuring a seamless and secure experience.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, with separate files for HTML, JavaScript, and potentially CSS. Key directories include:

- `docs`: GitHub Pages source files.
- `src`: Source code for HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - `assets`: Store images, logos, or other media files.
  - `js`: Contains JavaScript files for different functionalities.
  - `styles`: Houses CSS stylesheets.
